    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        Becoming a software developer excites me because it allows me to create solutions that can impact millions of people. 
        I enjoy solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and turning ideas into reality through code. 
        The ever-evolving nature of technology keeps me motivated to grow and challenge myself, while the collaborative 
        aspect of development fosters teamwork and innovation. Ultimately, I aspire to build applications that simplify 
        lives, connect people, and contribute to the progress of society.
